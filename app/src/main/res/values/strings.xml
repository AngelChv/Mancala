    <string name="how_to_play_text">The Tchuka Ruma board consists of 5 holes in a row. The first four are of the same size, each initially containing two “seeds” (beans, stones, buttons, or tokens), for a total of 8 seeds. The fifth hole, larger than the others, is the “Ruma” or storage pit, where all seeds must eventually be collected. The Ruma is initially empty.\n\nThe game involves the player performing a series of moves aimed at depositing all the seeds into the Ruma. The player must follow these rules:\n\ni) The player picks up all the “seeds” from any chosen hole and distributes them one by one into the following holes (a move called “sowing”), advancing towards the Ruma. If the Ruma is on the right, sowing proceeds from left to right;\n\nii) If, after placing a seed in the Ruma, there are still seeds left in hand, the player continues sowing on the opposite side of the board (if the Ruma is on the right, sowing continues from the left);\n\niii) When the last seed in hand is placed during a sowing, one of the following three outcomes occurs:\n\na) If the hole where the seed is placed contains more seeds, the player picks up all the seeds from that hole and continues sowing as described above;\n\nb) If the seed is placed in the Ruma, the player leaves the seed there and chooses any hole (except the Ruma) to continue sowing;\n\nc) If the seed is placed in an empty hole, the player loses the game and must start over from the beginning (as shown in the earlier image);\n\niv) The game ends when the player successfully collects all the seeds in the Ruma.</string>
